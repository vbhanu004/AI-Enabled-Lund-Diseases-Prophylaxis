# AI-Enabled-Lund-Diseases-Prophylaxis
Lung Disease Prediction from Chest X-Ray (CXR) using Convolutional Neural Network This repository is for our B.Tech major project. This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for predicting lung diseases from medical images. The CNN is trained on a labeled dataset of lung images to classify the presence of different lung diseases. The dataset used in this project is COVID-19 Radiography dataset. It includes images of healthy lungs and lungs affected by different diseases. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training, evaluation, and testing. The early detection of lung diseases play a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. This project aims to build a deep learning model based on CNNs that can analyze lung images and predict the presence of various lung diseases, such as pneumonia, lung opacity, covid, and others. The CNN model architecture used for this project is designed to efficiently process lung images and perform disease classification.
